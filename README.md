# Amazon Best Seller Scraper

This is a Python script that uses Beautiful Soup to scrape Amazon weekly book best seller lists and save as .csv files.

The user can adjust the starting date and number of weeks to query. The database begins the week of May 14, 2017. Note that anything more than 50 weeks can take a super long time to process.

The .csv includes week, raking, title, author, publisher, and agent (hey, authors -- maybe this is a good way to find your next agent!).
